     <h3><br>What is EV system?</h3>
     <i><p>An Electric Vehicle<sub>(EV)</sub> is a vehicle that uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. The vehicle can be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular sources, or can be powered autonomously by a battery or by converting fuel to electricity using a generator or fuel cells.<sup> [1]</sup>EVs include <u>road</u> and <u> rail vehicles, electric boats </u> and <mark> underwater  vessels, electric aircraft </mark> and <mark> electric spacecraft </mark>.</p></i>

<b> <p> Electric Bike: </p>
</b>
   <p> An electric bicycle, e-bike, electrically assisted pedal cycles, or electrically power assisted cycles[1] is a motorized bicycle with an integrated electric motor used to assist propulsion.<sup>[2][3]</sup> <br>Many kinds of e-bikes are available worldwide, <del>1955</del>but they generally fall into two broad categories: bikes that assist the rider's pedal-power (i.e. pedelecs) and bikes that add a throttle, integrating moped-style functionality. <br>Both retain the ability to be pedaled by the rider and are therefore not electric motorcycles. E-bikes use rechargeable batteries and typically are motor-powered up to 25 to 32 km/h (16 to 20 mph). High-powered varieties can often travel more than 45 km/h (28 mph).</p>
